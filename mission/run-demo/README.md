## Logs and Troubleshooting

- Additionally you can check the logs of SAP NetWeaver Add-On for Event enablement as described in the chapter [Monitoring and Logging](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e966e6c0e61443ebaa0270a4bae4b363/1.0/en-US/cff1acd831f744d59697525702ed0d3e.html).


- To monitor the Events from ECC open Transaction **SLG1** on your Backend

- In Transaction **SLG1** you can even view the trace of an event by choosing **More -> Views -> Show Trace**

- The regular SAP BTP Logs might also be helpful. Access the corresponding **Space** in your **Subaccount**. Then choose your Application and **Logs**.

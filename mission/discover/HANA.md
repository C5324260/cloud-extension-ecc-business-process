SAP HANA Cloud provides a single place to access, store, and process all enterprise data in real time. It is a cloud-native platform that reduces the complexity of multi-cloud or hybrid system landscapes. SAP HANA Cloud provides all of the advanced SAP HANA technologies for multi-model data processing in-memory or on disk. You can benefit from cloud qualities such as automatic software updates, elasticity, and low total cost of ownership by using SAP HANA Cloud either as a stand-alone solution or as an extension to your existing on-premise environment.

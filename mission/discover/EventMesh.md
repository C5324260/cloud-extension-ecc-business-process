# Discover the Basics of SAP Event Mesh

**SAP Event Mesh** (former Enterprise Messaging) is a cloud-based messaging service that enables you to connect applications and services within the SAP BTP. Scaling to a very high number of messages per second in real-time, you can send and receive messages reliably using open standards and protocols (MQTT, AMQP, REST).

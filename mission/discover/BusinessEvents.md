# Learn the Concepts Behind Business Events and Event-Driven Architectures

**Business Event** capabilities allow you to publish events from SAP sources such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, SAP ERP, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Customer Experience, and from external sources. The SAP Event Mesh service can transport enabled events to consumers, for example, extension applications built on SAP BTP. Event-driven architectures of this kind enable seamless communication and integration across different platforms.
